   //Change your code to assign a character value to myString. What do you notice?
   //it changes

  // it underlines red.
   //
   //Declare an long variable named myNumber, but do not assign anything to it. Next try to print out myNumber to the console. What happens?
   //
   //Change your code to assign the value 3.14 to myNumber. What do you notice?
   //
   //Change your code to assign the value 123L (Note the 'L' at the end) to myNumber.
   //
   //Change your code to assign the value 123 to myNumber.
   //
   //Why does assigning the value 3.14 to a variable declared as a long not compile, but assigning an integer value does?
   //
   //Change your code to declare myNumber as a float. Assign the value 3.14 to it. What happens? What are two ways we could fix this?
   //
   //Copy and paste the following code blocks one at a time and execute them

   //What is the difference between the above code blocks? Explain why the code outputs what it does.
   //
   //Try to create a variable named class. What happens?
//   int Class (); {
//
//               }
   //Object is the most generic type in Java. You can assign any value to a variable of type Object. What do you think will happen when the following code is run?
   //
   //
//   String theNumberThree = "three";
//   Object o = theNumberThree;
//   int three = (int) o;
   //Copy and paste the code above and then run it. Does the result match with your expectation?
   //
   //How is the above example different from the code block below?
   //
   //
   //int three = (int) "three";
   //What are the two different types of errors we are observing?
   //
   //Rewrite the following expressions using the relevant shorthand assignment operators:
   //
   //
//   int x = 4;
//   x = x + 5;
//
//   int x = 3;
//   int y = 4;
//   y = y * x;
//
//   int x = 10;
//   int y = 2;
//   x = x / y;
//   y = y - x;
//   //What happens if you assign a value to a numerical variable that is larger (or smaller) than the type can hold? What happens if you increment a numeric variable past the type's capacity?
   //
   //Hint: Integer.MAX_VALUE is a class constant (we'll learn more about these later) that holds the maximum value for the int type.
